Deep learning models for skin cancer detection are trained on large datasets of labeled images,
 with preprocessing techniques enhancing data quality. These models, often based on CNN architectures,
  are evaluated using metrics like sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC. Despite challenges in clinical implementation, 
  such as regulatory hurdles and integration into healthcare systems, both commercial and research-based systems assist 
  dermatologists in diagnosis. Future research aims to enhance accuracy, interpretability, and accessibility,
   with a focus on incorporating multimodal data and addressing issues of bias and robustness. Ultimately, 
   deep learning offers promising avenues for improving early detection and treatment outcomes in skin cancer.
